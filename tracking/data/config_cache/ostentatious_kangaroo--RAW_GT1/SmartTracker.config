#DEFINITIONS
# fov - min and max of range over which objects should be tracked, in feet
# n_init - number of required sequential high confidence detections to initialize an object
# sigma_high - minimum confidence to be considered a high confidence detection
# fsld_max - maximum number of frames for which an object can not have a high confidence detection before it is lost
# state_bounds - min,max for each state value (x,y,l,w,h,v) outside of which objects will be pruned
